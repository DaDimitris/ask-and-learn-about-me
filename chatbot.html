  Chatbot for Dimitris Dakos

  This file implements a very simple, self‑contained chatbot that uses a
  predefined knowledge base to answer questions about Dimitris Dakos.  The
  knowledge base contains information extracted from Dimitris’s CV and
  LinkedIn profile as of August 2025.  The bot will only answer
  questions that match the provided patterns; for anything else it will
  respond that the information is not available.  This avoids
  hallucinations and ensures compliance with the user’s requirements.

  To deploy this chatbot publicly you need to host this file on a web
  server (for example GitHub Pages or your personal website) and then
  link to it from your LinkedIn profile via the “Featured” section.  The
  link can be given a custom title like “Ask and Learn about me” on
  LinkedIn so visitors know what to expect.  See the accompanying
  instructions in the final answer for details on how to do that.

        pattern: /posts|what do you post|social media|linkedin activity|content/i,
        answer: `My LinkedIn activity spans a variety of themes connected to supply‑chain management, professional growth and broader social topics.  Recent highlights include congratulating the Thessaloniki Innovation Zone on winning the “Startup Ecosystem Star 2024” award and thanking Prof. Panayiotis Ketikidis for his leadership, sharing a World Economic Forum article about flexible parental leave and announcing my new role at OB Streem.  I also wrote a farewell message upon leaving AB Vassilopoulos after 16 years and shared a story about the supermarket’s core value “the good is for all of us”.  

In earlier posts I commented on the importance of continuous improvement (aiming for the top spot as a means to get better), the need to prioritise when solving problems, and how determination and other character skills underpin success.  I posted about AB Vassilopoulos running a 5 km marathon and promoted a Warehouse Shift Coordinator position, welcomed a new team member, and discussed how major life decisions require building relevant experiences.  I endorsed the World Economic Forum’s taxonomy for “Education 4.0” as a way to prepare future skills and emphasised that education offers the best long‑term returns.  I recommended the book **The Limits to Growth** and expressed interest in topics such as agile methods beyond software development, data science roles, diversity and inclusion (referencing Apple’s “Think Different” campaign) and the power of human imagination shown by the Apollo 11 Moon landing.  I also highlighted that employers value soft skills—especially communication.  

Around 2021–2022 I encouraged readers to try activities outside their routine (#wow!), noted that project management conferences were hybrid (combining agile and waterfall methods as well as on‑site and remote participation), and argued that hiring for attitude is more important than hiring solely for skills.  I explored emerging technologies by explaining what non‑fungible tokens (NFTs) are and how they relate to blockchain and smart contracts, and summarised an article advocating “no‑code” artificial intelligence tools to democratise AI.  I shared posts on container shipping profits and the challenges of supply‑chain disruption, as well as a C‑suite AI toolkit.  Another post reflected on how the COVID‑19 pandemic stress‑tested supply chains and included my certificate in Supply Chain Analytics Foundations.  I advocated learning Python to support AI and machine‑learning initiatives in operations and shared certificates from MIT’s Manufacturing Systems courses covering optimisation, simulation, queueing theory and inventory policies.  I also attended a Reuters IMPACT forum on climate action and completed LinkedIn Learning courses on influence and persuasion, Scrum basics, lean foundations and agile project management.  

Older posts mention completing MIT’s Manufacturing Systems rounds I and II, which covered stochastic processes, Markov chains, queuing systems, inventory replenishment policies and other advanced manufacturing topics.  I invited connections to join the Reuters IMPACT virtual forum and stressed the importance of agility and adaptability.  In 2020 I shared my digital badge for the PMP® certification, reposted Nike’s “Play inside, play for the world” message during the pandemic to encourage unity (#playfortheworld), and commented on a Harvard Business Review article about how the best managers identify and develop talent—highlighting that potential must be cultivated and materialised.  These posts collectively showcase my commitment to lifelong learning, innovation, leadership and social responsibility.`
